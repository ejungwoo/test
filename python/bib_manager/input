Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book.

These energetic heavy-ion beams are converted into intense radioactive isotope (RI) beams via projectile fragmentation of stable isotopes or in-flight fission of uranium isotopes by a superconducting fragment separator, BigRIPS. The three ring cyclotrons were commissioned in 2006, and RI beams from uranium were first obtained in 2007. The beam intensities and available ion species are increasing at RIBF, owing to the continuous efforts that have been made since the first beam. So far, we have accelerated deuteron, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, aluminum, calcium, zinc, krypton, xenon, and uranium beams with the superconducting ring cyclotron (SRC). The extracted beam intensities reached 1000 pnA for the helium and oxygen beams, and the calcium beam intensity exceeded 400 pnA recently. The intensities of the xenon and uranium beams are also increasing; they reached 24 and 3.6 pnA, respectively. This paper illustrates the construction, commissioning, and various improvements carried out for the RIBF accelerators, as well as the present accelerator performance.}"",

The RANSAC is used to classify tracks including pile-up, to remove uncorrelated noise hits, as well as to reconstruct the vertex of the reaction. The algorithm, developed within the Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) framework, was tested and validated by analyzing the 4He+4He reaction. Results, performance and quality of the proposed algorithm are presented and discussed in detail.}

The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free flowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data. There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many different platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.}

  abstract={A superconducting dipole magnet for a large-acceptance spectrometer named SAMURAI has been constructed and installed at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory. The important features of the SAMURAI superconducting dipole magnet are a large pole gap, a wide horizontal opening, and a large momentum bite. The magnet is an H-type dipole, having circular superconducting coils and cylindrical pole pieces with a diameter of 2 m and a pole gap of 880 mm. The coils are orderly wound by the wet winding method developed by Toshiba using a Nb/Ti superconducting wire. The upper and lower coils are installed in two separate cryostats and cooled by the liquid helium bath cooling method. Each cryostat has six cryocoolers: one for a coil vessel at 4 K, four for thermal shields, and one for high- <i>T</i><sub>C</sub> superconducting power leads. The size of the iron yoke is 6.7 m wide, 3.5 m deep, 4.64 m tall, and the total weight of the magnet is about 650 tons. The maximum magnetic field is 3.08 T at 563 A (1.922 MA turns/coil), which gives a bending power (field integral) of 7.05 Tm. The maximum stored energy amounts to 27.4 MJ and the inductance varies from 396 H to 150 H as the magnetic field increases. The fringe fields are smaller than 5 mT at 0.5 m from the magnet. The construction of the SAMURAI magnet started in 2008 and was completed in June 2011. The commissioning of the SAMURAI spectrometer was successfully performed using RI beams in March 2012.},

        journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
        abstract = {Finding and fitting circles from a set of points is a frequent problem in the data analysis of high-energy physics experiments. In a tracker immersed in a homogeneous magnetic field, tracks are close to perfect circles if projected to the bending plane. In a ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector, circles of photons around the crossing point of charged particles have to be found and their radii estimated. In both cases, non-negligible background may be present that tends to complicate the pattern recognition and to bias the circle fit. In this contribution we present a robust circle fit based on a modified Riemann fit that removes or significantly reduces the effect of background points. As in the standard Riemann fit, the measured points are projected to the Riemann sphere or paraboloid, and a plane is fitted to the projected points. The fit is made robust by replacing the usual least-squares regression by a least median of squares (LMS) regression. Because of the high breakdown point of the LMS estimator, the fit is insensitive to background points. The LMS plane is used to initialize the weights of an M-estimator that refits the plane in order to suppress eventual remaining outliers and to obtain the final circle parameters. The method is demonstrated on three sets of artificial data: points on a circle plus a comparable number of background points; points on two overlapping circles with additional background; and points obtained by the simulation of tracks in a drift chamber with mirror points and additional background. The results show high circle finding efficiency and small contamination of the final fitted circles.}

abstract = {We present a novel method of fitting trajectories of charged particles in high-energy physics particle detectors. The method fits a circular arc to two-dimensional measurements by mapping the measurements onto the Riemann sphere and fitting a plane to the transformed coordinates of the measurements. In this way, the non-linear task of circle fitting, which in general requires the application of some iterative procedure, is turned into a linear problem which can be solved in a fast, direct and non-iterative manner. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by stating results from two simulation experiments of tracks from the ATLAS Inner Detector Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). The first experiment shows that with a significantly lower execution time, the accuracy of the estimated track parameters is virtually as good as the accuracy obtained by applying an optimal, non-linear least-squares procedure. The second experiment focuses on track parameter estimation in the presence of ambiguous measurements. For this purpose, we have developed a new version of the Elastic Arms algorithm called the Elastic Planes algorithm. The algorithm produces results which are almost identical to the results from an optimal version of the Elastic Arms algorithm. The computational cost of our algorithm, however, is much lower.}

For tracking the lateral extent of the ionization cloud should be known. For tracking and for charged particle identification (PID), one must understand that energy loss of particles, ionization and detector output are related, but not identical. In this paper, I discuss the relevant physics processes involved in PID and tracking and the stochastic nature of the energy loss mechanism. These calculations can be made with analytic and Monte Carlo methods. The expression dE/dx should be abandoned; it is never relevant to the signals in a particle-by-particle analysis. Specific terms such as energy loss, energy deposition, ionization and pulse height should be used instead. It is important that an accurate data analysis requires attention to track segmentation. I will show that properties of straggling functions for gases and thin silicon detectors are similar for equivalent absorber thicknesses and general conclusions given for one absorber will be valid for others. Thus, these techniques can be used in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) and Silicon Drift Detectors. I will show how to use this formalism in the STAR and ALICE TPCs and describe how its use has improved the performance of the detector.}

        Abstract = {We present a Bayesian approach to particle identification (PID) within the ALICE experiment. The aim is to more effectively combine the particle identification capabilities of its various detectors. After a brief explanation of the adopted methodology and formalism, the performance of the Bayesian PID approach for charged pions, kaons and protons in the central barrel of ALICE is studied. PID is performed via measurements of specific energy loss ( {\$}d E/d x{\$}) and time of flight. PID efficiencies and misidentification probabilities are extracted and compared with Monte Carlo simulations using high-purity samples of identified particles in the decay channels {\$}K\^{}{\{}0{\}}{\_}{\{}S{\}} {$\backslash$}rightarrow {$\backslash$}pi\^{}{\{}-{\}}{$\backslash$}pi\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}, {\$} {$\backslash$}phi{$\backslash$}rightarrow K\^{}{\{}-{\}}K\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}, and {\$} {$\backslash$}Lambda{$\backslash$}rightarrow p {$\backslash$}pi\^{}{\{}-{\}}{\$}in p-Pb collisions at {\$} {$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}s{\_}{\{}NN{\}}{\}}=5.02{\$}TeV. In order to thoroughly assess the validity of the Bayesian approach, this methodology was used to obtain corrected {\$} p{\_}{\{}T{\}}{\$}spectra of pions, kaons, protons, and {\$}D\^{}{\{}0{\}}{\$}mesons in pp collisions at {\$} {$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=7{\$}TeV. In all cases, the results using Bayesian PID were found to be consistent with previous measurements performed by ALICE using a standard PID approach. For the measurement of {\$}D\^{}{\{}0{\}} {$\backslash$}rightarrow K\^{}{\{}-{\}}{$\backslash$}pi\^{}{\{}+{\}}{\$}, it was found that a Bayesian PID approach gave a higher signal-to-background ratio and a similar or larger statistical significance when compared with standard PID selections, despite a reduced identification efficiency.

We discuss and unravel the causes of correlations among the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei, the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at a density of 0.1fm-3, the derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy at the same density and the radii of moderate mass neutron stars. Constraints on the symmetry properties of nuclear matter from the binding energies of nuclei are examined. The extent to which forthcoming neutron skin measurements will further delimit the symmetry properties is investigated. The impact of symmetry energy constraints for the mass and moment of inertia contained within neutron star crusts and the threshold density for the nucleon direct Urca process, all of which are potentially measurable, is explored. We also comment on the minimum neutron star radius, assuming that only nucleonic matter exists within the star.}

The nuclear h used in this work consists of a realistic two-nucleon interaction, called v14, that fits the available nucleon-nucleon scattering data up to 425 MeV, and a phenomenological three nucleon interaction adjusted to reproduce the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter. The variational many-body theory of symmetric nuclear matter is extended to treat matter with neutron excess. Numerical and analytic studies of the Î²-dependence of various contributions to the nuclear matter energy show that at Ï± < 0.35 fmâ3 the Î²4 terms are very small, and that the interaction energy EI(Ï, Î²) defined as E(Ï, Î²) â TF(Ï, Î²), where TF is the Fermi-gas energy, is well approximated by EI0(Ï±) + Î²2EI2(Ï).

abstract = {A multiplicity trigger detector (MTD) was developed for the SÏRIT experiment that aims to probe the high-density symmetry energy via heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The MTD is designed to measure the charged-particle multiplicity in HICs to provide a trigger signal that can be used to select high-multiplicity events induced by central collisions. The MTD consists of two side-walls segmented into 30 plastic scintillation paddles, each equipped with a multi-pixel photon counter. A custom board with EASIROC front-end ASIC is used as readout electronics. A multiplicity logic signal is generated by an on-board FPGA that processes the discriminated signals from EASIROCs. The overall latency of the whole detector system for outputting the trigger is less than 100ns, including 52ns of electronics latency for processing the signals. During the measurement of 112Sn+124Sn reactions at an incident energy of 270MeV/nucleon, the minimum multiplicity threshold of the MTD was set to 4, where the overall trigger efficiency was obtained to be about 39% for inclusive nuclear reactions. A simulation study with a numerical calculation of HICs found that the central collisions of impact parameters of less than 4fm can be triggered with a high efficiency of more than 95% by the experimental trigger condition.}

        Abstract = {Experimental information on fragment emissions is important in understanding the dynamics of nuclear collisions and in the development of transport model simulating heavy-ion collisions. The composition of complex fragments emitted in the heavy-ion collisions can be explained by statistical models, which assume that thermal equilibrium is achieved at collision energies below 100 MeV/u. Our new experimental data together with theoretical analyses for light particles from Sn+Sn collisions at 270 MeV/u, suggest that the hypothesis of thermal equilibrium breaks down for particles emitted with high transfer momentum. To inspect the system's properties in such limit, the scaling features of the yield ratios of particles from two systems, a neutron-rich system of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}132{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}+{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}124{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}{\$}{\$}and a nearly symmetric system of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}108{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}+{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}112{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}{\$}{\$}, are examined in the framework of the statistical multifragmentation model and the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model. The isoscaling from low energy particles agree with both models. However the observed breakdown of isoscaling for particles with high transverse momentum cannot be explained by the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model.},

abstract = {The large imbalance in the neutron and proton densities in very neutron rich systems increases the nuclear symmetry energy so that it governs many aspects of neutron stars and their mergers. Extracting the density dependence of the symmetry energy therefore constitutes an important scientific objective. Many analyses have been limited to extracting values for the symmetry energy, S0, and its “derivative”, L, at saturation density ρ0≈2.6×1014g/cm3 ≈0.16nucleons/fm3, resulting in constraints that appear contradictory. We show that most experimental observables actually probe the symmetry energy at densities far from ρ0, making the extracted values of S0 or L imprecise. By focusing on the densities these observables actually probe, we obtain a detailed picture of the density dependence of the symmetry energy from 0.25ρ0 to 2.0ρ0. From this experimentally derived density functional, we extract L01=54±6 MeV corresponding to the symmetry pressure of P01=1.8±0.2 MeV/fm3 at ρ≈0.10fm−3, a neutron skin thickness for P208b of Rnp=0.23±0.03 fm, and symmetry pressure at saturation density of P0=4.4±1.3 MeV/fm3. The extrapolated symmetry pressure at high density is consistent with results from recent measurements of neutron star radii from NICER and deformability from LIGO.}
