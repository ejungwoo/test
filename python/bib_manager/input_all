        Abstract = {A new statistical approach is adopted which, through a suitable analysis of light clusters emitted in heavy-ion collisions, allows us to evaluate temperature and free-nucleon densities of the emission source. All known data concerning the emission of2H,3H,3He,4He measured in a common experiment are used. These data refer to 19 heavy-ion reactions studied at projectile energies between 26 and 2100 MeV per nucleon. Analysed events are only those attributable to the equilibrium component through carefully adopted selections. Among the results, a correlation is observed between temperatureT and total free-nucleon density ϱtF of the emission source. A nuclear-matter model is formulated in order to compare its quantitative predictions with the observed (T, ϱtF) correlation. A good agreement is found by this comparison.},

The most central part, 1% of the total measured cross section was selected by means of a multidimensional analysis of the experimental observables. The detected isotopes of light fragments (3â©œZâ©œ8) provided information on breakup temperatures of the emitting sources. The spaceâtime structure of these sources was deduced from fragment correlations. An oddâeven effect in the fragment production, enhanced by the isospin of the entrance channel, was observed. Freeze-out unbound neutron-to-proton relative densities for both studied reactions have been deduced, indicating for a possible isospin distillation mechanism related to a phenomenon of the liquidâgas phase transition in asymmetric systems.}

abstract = {Time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in nuclear and particle physics. They are particularly useful when measuring reaction products from heavy ion collisions. Most nuclear experiments at low energy are performed in a fixed target configuration, in which the unreacted beam will pass through the detection volume. As the beam intensity increases, the buildup of positive ions created from the ionization of the detector gas by the beam creates the main source of space charge, distorting the nominal electric field of the TPC. This has a profound effect on the accuracy of the measured momenta of the emitted particles. In this paper we will discuss the magnitude of the effects and construct an observable appropriate for fixed target experiments to study the effects. We will present an algorithm for correcting the space charge and discuss some of the implications it has on the momentum determination.}

A pattern recognition algorithm which performs helix track finding and handles overlapping pulses is described.

abstract = {In the past two decades, pions created in the high density regions of heavy ion collisions have been predicted to be sensitive at high densities to the symmetry energy term in the nuclear equation of state, a property that is key to our understanding of neutron stars. In a new experiment designed to study the symmetry energy, the multiplicities of negatively and positively charged pions have been measured with high accuracy for central 132Sn+124Sn, 112Sn+124Sn, and 108Sn+112Sn collisions at E/A=270Â MeV with the SÏRIT Time Projection Chamber. While individual pion multiplicities are measured to 4% accuracy, those of the charged pion multiplicity ratios are measured to 2% accuracy. We compare these data to predictions from seven major transport models. The calculations reproduce qualitatively the dependence of the multiplicities and their ratios on the total neutron and proton number in the colliding systems. However, the predictions of the transport models from different codes differ too much to allow extraction of reliable constraints on the symmetry energy from the data. This finding may explain previous contradictory conclusions on symmetry energy constraints obtained from pion data in Au+Au system. These new results call for still better understanding of the differences among transport codes, and new observables that are more sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy.}

After initial efforts to obtain isoscaling with the âtraditionalâ approach of using pairs of systems differing in their isospin asymmetry (or neutron-to-proton ratio N/Z), âintra-systemâ isoscaling for each of these four systems was obtained using fragment sources restricted in two narrow N/Z regions (one neutron-rich and one neutron-poor). The observed isoscaling behavior was excellent and the isoscaling parameter Î± was found to decrease with increasing excitation energy. Corrections due to undetected neutrons were also taken into account in the source N/Z determination by using the theoretical models DIT (Deep Inelastic Transfer) and SMM (Statistical Multifragmentation Model) along with a software replica of the experimental setup. These corrections were applied to the determination of the parameter Î (expressing the difference in the isospin asymmetry of the two sources used in the isoscaling). The reduced isoscaling parameter Î±/Î was obtained and found to decrease as the excitation energy of the quasiprojectile source increases, in good agreement with recent work on reconstructed mass Aâ80 quasiprojectiles. This decrease of Î±/Î may point to a decrease of the symmetry energy coefficient with increasing excitation energy.}

abstract = {The ultimate goal of studying isospin physics via heavy-ion reactions with neutron-rich, stable and/or radioactive nuclei is to explore the isospin dependence of in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the equation of state of neutron-rich nuclear matter, particularly the isospin-dependent term in the equation of state, i.e., the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Because of its great importance for understanding many phenomena in both nuclear physics and astrophysics, the study of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy has been the main focus of the intermediate-energy heavy-ion physics community during the last decade, and significant progress has been achieved both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, a number of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed us to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities. The impact of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were found to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities provided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around the world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the forefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the major progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy ion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in this field.}

We also propose a new prescription by which we can avoid the spurious zero-point energies of center-of-mass motion of fragment wave packets. The fragment production cross sections of the 12C + 12C reaction at 28.7 MeV/nucleon are analyzed by this new method. It is shown that the basic feature of the data including the large cross section of α-particle is reproduced well by the theory. Furthermore we show that the data are reproduced very well when we take into account the statistical cascade decays of the produced fragments, which verifies the great usefulness of the new microscopic simulation framework.}"",

It includes core services for detector simulation and offline analysis. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free flowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data. There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many different platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.}

Many TPC readout electronics currently only have a single gain output with a fixed dynamic range. In a recent set of experiments using the SAMURAI Pion-Reconstruction and Ion-Tracker (SÏRIT) TPC, it was important to simultaneously measure relativistic pions and heavy ion tracks from the same collisions. As the ionization from a trackâs energy loss is collected and multiplied by the anode wires, a distribution of image charges is induced on the TPC read-out pads. If the avalanche on a wire is large enough, the charge collected by pads directly underneath will saturate the readout electronics; pads farther away in the distribution will not be saturated. Using these unsaturated pads and the known pad distribution function, we can estimate the charge on saturated pads, increasing the dynamic range by a factor of 5.}

The SÏRIT experiment is designed for heavy ion collision experiments with radioactive ion beams, where a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with 12096 pixelized readout pads is employed as the main device. Since the TPC is located on the beam line, the readout electronics must handle small signals from pions as well as very large signals from beam or large fragment particles. Operation of the GET electronics during experiment functioned well using 270 time-bucket readout with 25 MHz sampling at an event Data acquisition (DAQ) rate of 60 Hz. Using the slope information of acquired signals it is possible to extend the dynamic range of dE/dx information compared to using the peak height information. However, huge signals arising from energetic ÎŽ-rays produced by un-interacted projectiles induce dead channels, which can be recovered after 70 ÎŒs on average.}

The TPC is fully equipped with a newly-developed read-out electronics system, GET electronics. The trigger logic to select events of the TPC based on the ancillary detectors was tested. The analysis software, SpiRITROOT, was developed to analyze the S$\pi$RIT TPC data to determine the best trigger logic for upcoming experiments.},

abstract = {The deexcitation of the primary hot fragments, produced in the breakup of an excited nuclear source, during their propagation under the influence of their mutual Coulomb repulsion is studied in the framework of a recently developed hybrid model. The latter is based on the Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM), describing the prompt breakup of the source, whereas the particle emission from the hot fragments, that decay while traveling away from each other, is treated by the Weisskopf-Ewing evaporation model. Since this treatment provides an event by event description of the process, in which the classical trajectories of the fragments are followed using molecular dynamics techniques, it allows one to study observables such as two-particle correlations and infer the extent to which the corresponding observables may provide information on the multifragment production mechanisms. Our results suggest that the framework on which these treatments are based may be considerably constrained by such analyses. They imply that information obtained from these model calculations may provide feedback to the theory of nuclear interferometry. In particular, our results do not support the hypothesis that the total momentum of the selected pair of particles used in the two-particle correlations remains constant during the post-breakup dynamics. Furthermore, the correlations may be appreciably affected by this fact. We also found that neutron deficient fragments should hold information more closely related to the breakup region than neutron rich ones, as they are produced in much earlier stages of the post breakup dynamics than the latter.}

The double ratio thus suffers less systematic errors. Within the IBUU04 transport model the double neutron/proton ratio is shown to have about the same sensitivity to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy as the single neutron/proton ratio in the neutron-rich system involved. The double neutron/proton ratio is therefore more useful for further constraining the symmetry energy of neutron-rich matter.}

The data are compared with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) calculations and the rapidity distributions can be reproduced after adjusting the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections. The double ratios between the two reaction systems taken for the relative yields of deuteron to proton (d/p) and triton to proton (t/p) are further examined in the midrapidity domain, where the adjustments in the AMD calculations do not affect much on them. The d/p and t/p double ratios at midrapidity agree well with the ratio of the system neutron numbers and its squared value, respectively, and the rapidity dependence of these double ratios is consistent with a picture of partial mixing of colliding nuclei. By comparing with the AMD model which shows a strong symmetry energy dependence of the t/p double ratio, the experimental result in the midrapidity domain favors the calculation with a symmetry-energy slope parameter around L=46 MeV rather than L=108 MeV.}

Within the assumptions of the Albergo thermometric technique, this independence is consistent with the attainment of full chemical equilibrium for each reaction at the same common temperature.

abstract = {A simple but novel driver system has been developed to operate the wire gating grid of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This system connects the wires of the gating grid to its driver via low impedance transmission lines. When the gating grid is open, all wires have the same voltage allowing drift electrons, produced by the ionization of the detector gas molecules, to pass through to the anode wires. When the grid is closed, the wires have alternating higher and lower voltages causing the drift electrons to terminate at the more positive wires. Rapid opening of the gating grid with low pickup noise is achieved by quickly shorting the positive and negative wires to attain the average bias potential with N-type and P-type MOSFET switches. The circuit analysis and simulation software SPICE shows that the driver restores the gating grid voltage to 90% of the opening voltage in less than 0.20Âµs, for small values of the termination resistors. When tested in the experimental environment of a time projection chamber larger termination resistors were chosen so that the driver opens the gating grid in 0.35Âµs. In each case, opening time is basically characterized by the RC constant given by the resistance of the switches and terminating resistors and the capacitance of the gating grid and its transmission line. By adding a second pair of N-type and P-type MOSFET switches, the gating grid is closed by restoring 99% of the original charges to the wires within 3Âµs.}

abstract = {Light-particle emission from Au+Au collisions has been studied in the bombarding-energy range 100â250 AÂ·MeV, using ÎEâER telescopes in coincidence with the FOPI detector in its phase I configuration. Center-of-mass energy spectra have been measured for Z = 1,2 isotopes emitted in central collisions at CM polar angles between 60Â° and 90Â°. Evidence for a collective expansion is reported, on the basis of the mean kinetic energies of hydrogen isotopes. Comparison is presented with statistical calculations (WIX code). For CM kinetic energy spectra, fair agreement is found between data and a recently developed transport model.}

abstract = {A review is given on the studies of formation of light clusters and heavier fragments in heavy-ion collisions at incident energies from several tens of MeV/nucleon to several hundred MeV/nucleon, focusing on dynamical aspects and on microscopic theoretical descriptions. Existing experimental data already clarify basic characteristics of expanding and fragmenting systems typically in central collisions, where cluster correlations cannot be ignored. Cluster correlations appear almost everywhere in excited low-density nuclear many-body systems and nuclear matter in statistical equilibrium where the properties of a cluster may be influenced by the medium. On the other hand, transport models to solve the time evolution have been developed based on the single-nucleon distribution function. Different types of transport models are reviewed putting emphasis both on theoretical features and practical performances in the description of fragmentation. A key concept to distinguish different models is how to consistently handle single-nucleon motions in the mean field, fluctuation or branching induced by two-nucleon collisions, and localization of nucleons to form fragments and clusters. Some transport codes have been extended to treat light clusters explicitly. Results indicate that cluster correlations can have strong impacts on global collision dynamics and correlations between light clusters should also be taken into account.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We propose the existence of a lower bound on the energy of pure neutron matter (PNM) on the basis of unitary-gas considerations. We discuss its justification from experimental studies of cold atoms as well as from theoretical studies of neutron matter. We demonstrate that this bound results in limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference between the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this bound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter S0. In addition, for assumed values of S0 above this minimum, this bound implies both upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter L,which describes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower bound on neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds are found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM and constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because several equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics simulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that violate these bounds. Furthermore, below the nuclear saturation density, the bound on neutron-matter energies leads to a lower limit to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which leads to upper limits to the nuclear surface symmetry parameter and the neutron-star crustâcore boundary. We also obtain a lower limit to the neutron-skin thicknesses of neutron-rich nuclei. Above the nuclear saturation density, the bound on neutron-matter energies also leads to an upper limit to the symmetry energy, with implications for neutron-star cooling via the direct Urca process.}

    abstract = { Atomic nuclei consist of fermionsâprotons and neutronsâbound together by interactions. Because two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, both protons and neutrons have a broad range of momenta inside the nucleus. Hen et al. scattered electrons off nuclei of varying sizes to study the distribution of the protons' and neutrons' momenta. Protons formed high-momentum pairs with neutrons much more frequently than with other protons. Thus, surprisingly, the average momentum of a neutron was lower than that of a proton, even in nuclei with a larger number of neutrons than protons. Science, this issue p. 614 Electron scattering off various nuclear targets is used to deduce the momentum distributions of nucleons. The atomic nucleus is composed of two different kinds of fermions: protons and neutrons. If the protons and neutrons did not interact, the Pauli exclusion principle would force the majority of fermions (usually neutrons) to have a higher average momentum. Our high-energy electron-scattering measurements using 12C, 27Al, 56Fe, and 208Pb targets show that even in heavy, neutron-rich nuclei, short-range interactions between the fermions form correlated high-momentum neutron-proton pairs. Thus, in neutron-rich nuclei, protons have a greater probability than neutrons to have momentum greater than the Fermi momentum. This finding has implications ranging from nuclear few-body systems to neutron stars and may also be observable experimentally in two-spinâstate, ultracold atomic gas systems. }

New Skyrme parametrizations are proposed and some of their spectroscopic properties are presented, e.g. S2n, S2p and r.m.s. radii for different isotopic and isotonic series.}

abstract = {The LIGO-Virgo collaboration detection of the binary neutron-star merger event, GW170817, has expanded efforts to understand the Equation of State (EoS) of nuclear matter. These measurements provide new constraints on the overall pressure, but do not elucidate its origins, by not distinguishing the contribution to the pressure from symmetry energy which governs much of the internal structure of a neutron star. By combining the neutron star EoS extracted from the GW170817 event and the EoS of symmetric matter from nucleus-nucleus collision experiments, we extract the symmetry pressure, which is the difference in pressure between neutron and nuclear matter over the density region from 1.2Ï0 to 4.5Ï0. While the uncertainties in the symmetry pressure are large, they can be reduced with new experimental and astrophysical results.}

We find that the extraction of useful information on the isospin-dependent part of the equation of state of nuclear matter from proton or neutron elliptic flows is obstructed by their sensitivity to model parameters and in-medium values of nucleonânucleon cross-sections. Opposite to that, neutronâproton elliptic flow difference shows little dependence on those variables while its dependence on the isospin asymmetric EoS is enhanced, making it more suitable for a model independent constraining of the high-density behaviour of asy-EoS. Comparison with existing experimental FOPI-LAND neutronâhydrogen data can be used to set an upper limit to the softness of asy-EoS. Successful constraining of the asy-EoS via neutronâproton elliptic flow difference will require experimental data of higher accuracy than presently available.}

It is found that the emission time of these light clusters depends on their masses. For clusters with same momentum per nucleon, heavier ones are emitted earlier. Both the yield and energy spectrum of light clusters are sensitive to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy, with more light clusters produced in the case of a stiff symmetry energy. On the other hand, effects due to the stiffness of the isoscalar part of nuclear equation of state and the medium dependence of nucleonânucleon cross sections on light cluster production are unimportant. We have also studied the correlation functions of clusters, and they are affected by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy as well, with the stiff symmetry energy giving a stronger anti-correlation of light clusters, particularly for those with large kinetic energies. Dependence of light cluster production on the centrality and incident energy of heavy-ion collisions as well as the mass of the reaction system is also investigated.}

We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.}

Except possible phase transitions, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry {\$} E{\_}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}rm sym{\}}{\}}({$\backslash$}rho){\$} is the most uncertain part of the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter especially at supra-saturation densities. Much progresses have been made in recent years in predicting the symmetry energy and understanding why it is still very uncertain using various microscopic nuclear many-body theories and phenomenological models. Simultaneously, significant progresses have also been made in probing the symmetry energy in both terrestrial nuclear laboratories and astrophysical observatories. In light of the GW170817 event as well as ongoing or planned nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations probing the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter, we review recent progresses and identify new challenges to the best knowledge we have on several selected topics critical for understanding astrophysical effects of the nuclear symmetry energy.},

abstract = {The nuclear symmetry energy characterizes the variation of the binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio of a nuclear system is varied. This is one of the most important features of nuclear physics in general, since it is just related to the two component nature of the nuclear systems. As such it is one of the most relevant physical parameters that affect the physics of many phenomena and nuclear processes. This review paper presents a survey of the role and relevance of the nuclear symmetry energy in different fields of research and of the accuracy of its determination from the phenomenology and from the microscopic many-body theory. In recent years, a great interest was devoted not only to the Nuclear Matter symmetry energy at saturation density but also to its whole density dependence, which is an essential ingredient for our understanding of many phenomena. We analyze the nuclear symmetry energy in different realms of nuclear physics and astrophysics. In particular we consider the nuclear symmetry energy in relation to nuclear structure, astrophysics of Neutron Stars and supernovae, and heavy ion collision experiments, trying to elucidate the connections of these different fields on the basis of the symmetry energy peculiarities. The interplay between experimental and observational data and theoretical developments is stressed. The expected future developments and improvements are schematically addressed, together with most demanded experimental and theoretical advances for the next few years.}

abstract = {Neutron stars are valuable laboratories for the study of dense matter. Recent observations have uncovered both massive and low-mass neutron stars and have also set constraints on neutron star radii. The largest mass measurements are powerfully influencing the high-density equation of state because of the existence of the neutron star maximum mass. The smallest mass measurements, and the distributions of masses, have implications for the progenitors and formation mechanisms of neutron stars. The ensemble of mass and radius observations can realistically restrict the properties of dense matter and, in particular, the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. Simultaneously, various nuclear experiments are progressively restricting the ranges of parameters describing the symmetry properties of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, new theoretical studies of pure neutron matter are providing insights. These observational, experimental, and theoretical constraints of dense matter, when combined, are now revealing a remarkable convergence. }

abstract = {This review is devoted to the Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMFM) developed in Copenhagen more than 10 years ago and widely used now for interpreting experimental data on multiple fragment production in different nuclear reactions. The model is based on the assumption of simultaneous break-up of a thermalized nuclear system. Basic principles and different realizations of the statistical approach to the nuclear multifragmentation are described in detail. Special emphasis is put on the implementation of specific nuclear features such as finite size effects, internal excitation of fragments, their strong and Coulomb interaction. Hot primary fragments are treated within the liquid-drop approximation. An efficient Monte Carlo method is proposed for generating microcanonical ensembles of break-up channels. Deexcitation of hot fragments via evaporation and Fermi break-up is also included in the numerical code. The evolution of nuclear disintegration mechanisms with increasing excitation energy, from compound nucleus to multifragmentation and vaporization, follows naturally from the model. Observable signals of multifragmentation are discussed and numerous applications of the model for analyzing experimental data are demonstrated. In particular, hybrid models, combining dynamical simulations of non-equilibrium stages of the reaction with statistical break-up of thermalized intermediate systems, are described. The âbacktracingâ method of reconstructing parameters of decaying sources from experimental data is also presented.}

abstract = {A great many observables seen in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions can be explained on the basis of statistical equilibrium. Calculations based on statistical equilibrium can be implemented in microcanonical ensemble (energy and number of particles in the system are kept fixed), canonical ensemble (temperature and number of particles are kept fixed) or grand canonical ensemble (fixed temperature and a variable number of particles but with an assigned average). This paper deals with calculations with canonical ensembles. A recursive relation developed recently allows calculations with arbitrary precision for many nuclear problems. Calculations are done to study the nature of phase transition in intermediate energy heavy ion collision, to study the caloric curves for nuclei and to explore the possibility of negative specific heat because of the finiteness of nuclear systems. The model can also be used for detailed calculations of other observables not connected with phase transitions, such as populations of selected isotopes in a heavy ion collision. The model also serves a pedagogical purpose. For the problems at hand, both the canonical and grand canonical solutions are obtainable with arbitrary accuracy hence we can compare the values of observables obtained from the canonical calculations with those from the grand canonical. Sometimes, very interesting discrepancies are found. To illustrate the predictive power of the model, calculated observables are compared with data from the central collisions of Sn isotopes.}

We present a Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck computer simulation of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies where the in-medium cross section is incorporated into the collision term. The solution of the BUU equation at different beam energies gives an estimate of how the number of collisions during the heavy-ion reaction is changed by medium corrections to the NN cross section. The influence of these medium corrections on the number of collisions in the heavy-ion reaction is discussed.}

The TPC is the central element in a suite of detectors that surrounds the interaction vertex. The TPC provides complete coverage around the beam-line, and provides complete tracking for charged particles within Â±1.8 units of pseudo-rapidity of the center-of-mass frame. Charged particles with momenta greater than 100MeV/c are recorded. Multiplicities in excess of 3000 tracks per event are routinely reconstructed in the software.

        Abstract = {The Hough Transform algorithm is a popular image analysis method that is widely used to perform global pattern recognition in images through the identification of local patterns in a suitably chosen parameter space. The algorithm can also be used to perform track reconstruction; to estimate the trajectory of individual particles when passed through the active elements of a detector volume. This paper presents a fast reconstruction method for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) of the ALICE experiment at LHC. The method, that combines a linear Hough Transform algorithm with a fast filling of the Hough Transform parameter space, is developed within AliceO2, the new computing framework of ALICE for RUN3.},

It includes core services for detector simulation and offline analysis. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free flowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data. There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many different platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.}

  abstract={A superconducting dipole magnet for a large-acceptance spectrometer named SAMURAI has been constructed and installed at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory. The important features of the SAMURAI superconducting dipole magnet are a large pole gap, a wide horizontal opening, and a large momentum bite. The magnet is an H-type dipole, having circular superconducting coils and cylindrical pole pieces with a diameter of 2 m and a pole gap of 880 mm. The coils are orderly wound by the wet winding method developed by Toshiba using a Nb/Ti superconducting wire. The upper and lower coils are installed in two separate cryostats and cooled by the liquid helium bath cooling method. Each cryostat has six cryocoolers: one for a coil vessel at 4 K, four for thermal shields, and one for high- <i>T</i><sub>C</sub> superconducting power leads. The size of the iron yoke is 6.7 m wide, 3.5 m deep, 4.64 m tall, and the total weight of the magnet is about 650 tons. The maximum magnetic field is 3.08 T at 563 A (1.922 MA turns/coil), which gives a bending power (field integral) of 7.05 Tm. The maximum stored energy amounts to 27.4 MJ and the inductance varies from 396 H to 150 H as the magnetic field increases. The fringe fields are smaller than 5 mT at 0.5 m from the magnet. The construction of the SAMURAI magnet started in 2008 and was completed in June 2011. The commissioning of the SAMURAI spectrometer was successfully performed using RI beams in March 2012.},

        journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
        abstract = {Finding and fitting circles from a set of points is a frequent problem in the data analysis of high-energy physics experiments. In a tracker immersed in a homogeneous magnetic field, tracks are close to perfect circles if projected to the bending plane. In a ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector, circles of photons around the crossing point of charged particles have to be found and their radii estimated. In both cases, non-negligible background may be present that tends to complicate the pattern recognition and to bias the circle fit. In this contribution we present a robust circle fit based on a modified Riemann fit that removes or significantly reduces the effect of background points. As in the standard Riemann fit, the measured points are projected to the Riemann sphere or paraboloid, and a plane is fitted to the projected points. The fit is made robust by replacing the usual least-squares regression by a least median of squares (LMS) regression. Because of the high breakdown point of the LMS estimator, the fit is insensitive to background points. The LMS plane is used to initialize the weights of an M-estimator that refits the plane in order to suppress eventual remaining outliers and to obtain the final circle parameters. The method is demonstrated on three sets of artificial data: points on a circle plus a comparable number of background points; points on two overlapping circles with additional background; and points obtained by the simulation of tracks in a drift chamber with mirror points and additional background. The results show high circle finding efficiency and small contamination of the final fitted circles.}

abstract = {We present a novel method of fitting trajectories of charged particles in high-energy physics particle detectors. The method fits a circular arc to two-dimensional measurements by mapping the measurements onto the Riemann sphere and fitting a plane to the transformed coordinates of the measurements. In this way, the non-linear task of circle fitting, which in general requires the application of some iterative procedure, is turned into a linear problem which can be solved in a fast, direct and non-iterative manner. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by stating results from two simulation experiments of tracks from the ATLAS Inner Detector Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). The first experiment shows that with a significantly lower execution time, the accuracy of the estimated track parameters is virtually as good as the accuracy obtained by applying an optimal, non-linear least-squares procedure. The second experiment focuses on track parameter estimation in the presence of ambiguous measurements. For this purpose, we have developed a new version of the Elastic Arms algorithm called the Elastic Planes algorithm. The algorithm produces results which are almost identical to the results from an optimal version of the Elastic Arms algorithm. The computational cost of our algorithm, however, is much lower.}

For tracking the lateral extent of the ionization cloud should be known. For tracking and for charged particle identification (PID), one must understand that energy loss of particles, ionization and detector output are related, but not identical. In this paper, I discuss the relevant physics processes involved in PID and tracking and the stochastic nature of the energy loss mechanism. These calculations can be made with analytic and Monte Carlo methods. The expression dE/dx should be abandoned; it is never relevant to the signals in a particle-by-particle analysis. Specific terms such as energy loss, energy deposition, ionization and pulse height should be used instead. It is important that an accurate data analysis requires attention to track segmentation. I will show that properties of straggling functions for gases and thin silicon detectors are similar for equivalent absorber thicknesses and general conclusions given for one absorber will be valid for others. Thus, these techniques can be used in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) and Silicon Drift Detectors. I will show how to use this formalism in the STAR and ALICE TPCs and describe how its use has improved the performance of the detector.}

abstract = {The roles of isospin asymmetry in nuclei and neutron stars are investigated using a range of potential and field-theoretical models of nucleonic matter. The parameters of these models are fixed by fitting the properties of homogeneous bulk matter and closed-shell nuclei. We discuss and unravel the causes of correlations among the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei, the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at a density of 0.1fm-3, the derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy at the same density and the radii of moderate mass neutron stars. Constraints on the symmetry properties of nuclear matter from the binding energies of nuclei are examined. The extent to which forthcoming neutron skin measurements will further delimit the symmetry properties is investigated. The impact of symmetry energy constraints for the mass and moment of inertia contained within neutron star crusts and the threshold density for the nucleon direct Urca process, all of which are potentially measurable, is explored. We also comment on the minimum neutron star radius, assuming that only nucleonic matter exists within the star.}

The nuclear h used in this work consists of a realistic two-nucleon interaction, called v14, that fits the available nucleon-nucleon scattering data up to 425 MeV, and a phenomenological three nucleon interaction adjusted to reproduce the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter. The variational many-body theory of symmetric nuclear matter is extended to treat matter with neutron excess. Numerical and analytic studies of the Î²-dependence of various contributions to the nuclear matter energy show that at Ï± < 0.35 fmâ3 the Î²4 terms are very small, and that the interaction energy EI(Ï, Î²) defined as E(Ï, Î²) â TF(Ï, Î²), where TF is the Fermi-gas energy, is well approximated by EI0(Ï±) + Î²2EI2(Ï). The calculated symmetry energy at equilibrium density is 30 MeV and it increases from 15 to 38 MeV as Ï± increases from 0.05 to 0.35 fmâ3.}

abstract = {A multiplicity trigger detector (MTD) was developed for the SÏRIT experiment that aims to probe the high-density symmetry energy via heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The MTD is designed to measure the charged-particle multiplicity in HICs to provide a trigger signal that can be used to select high-multiplicity events induced by central collisions. The MTD consists of two side-walls segmented into 30 plastic scintillation paddles, each equipped with a multi-pixel photon counter. A custom board with EASIROC front-end ASIC is used as readout electronics. A multiplicity logic signal is generated by an on-board FPGA that processes the discriminated signals from EASIROCs. The overall latency of the whole detector system for outputting the trigger is less than 100ns, including 52ns of electronics latency for processing the signals. During the measurement of 112Sn+124Sn reactions at an incident energy of 270MeV/nucleon, the minimum multiplicity threshold of the MTD was set to 4, where the overall trigger efficiency was obtained to be about 39% for inclusive nuclear reactions. A simulation study with a numerical calculation of HICs found that the central collisions of impact parameters of less than 4fm can be triggered with a high efficiency of more than 95% by the experimental trigger condition.}

abstract = {Transport models are the main method to obtain physics information on the nuclear equation of state and in-medium properties of particles from low to relativistic-energy heavy-ion collisions. The Transport Model Evaluation Project (TMEP) has been pursued to test the robustness of transport model predictions in reaching consistent conclusions from the same type of physical model. To this end, calculations under controlled conditions of physical input and set-up were performed with various participating codes. These included both calculations of nuclear matter in a box with periodic boundary conditions, which test separately selected ingredients of a transport code, and more realistic calculations of heavy-ion collisions. Over the years, six studies have been performed within this project. In this intermediate review, we summarize and discuss the present status of the project. We also provide condensed descriptions of the 26 participating codes, which contributed to some part of the project. These include the major codes in use today. After a compact description of the underlying transport approaches, we review the main results of the studies completed so far. They show, that in box calculations the differences between the codes can be well understood and a convergence of the results can be reached. These studies also highlight the systematic differences between the two families of transport codes, known under the names of BoltzmannâUehlingâUhlenbeck (BUU) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) type codes. However, when the codes were compared in full heavy-ion collisions using different physical models, as recently for pion production, they still yielded substantially different results. This calls for further comparisons of heavy-ion collisions with controlled models and of box comparisons of important ingredients, like momentum-dependent fields, which are currently underway. Our evaluation studies often indicate improved strategies in performing transport simulations and thus can provide guidance to code developers. Results of transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions from a given code will have more significance if the code can be validated against benchmark calculations such as the ones summarized in this review.}

Emphasis is placed on recent progress in determining the equation of state of compressed fireball nuclear matter from the observed pion yield in central collisions. Further, the information derived from apparent spectral temperatures is critically examined, along with a discussion of thermal and chemical equilibrium attainment in the reactions, as revealed by particle spectra and yields.}

abstract = {Transport models are the main method to obtain physics information on the nuclear equation of state and in-medium properties of particles from low to relativistic-energy heavy-ion collisions. The Transport Model Evaluation Project (TMEP) has been pursued to test the robustness of transport model predictions in reaching consistent conclusions from the same type of physical model. To this end, calculations under controlled conditions of physical input and set-up were performed with various participating codes. These included both calculations of nuclear matter in a box with periodic boundary conditions, which test separately selected ingredients of a transport code, and more realistic calculations of heavy-ion collisions. Over the years, six studies have been performed within this project. In this intermediate review, we summarize and discuss the present status of the project. We also provide condensed descriptions of the 26 participating codes, which contributed to some part of the project. These include the major codes in use today. After a compact description of the underlying transport approaches, we review the main results of the studies completed so far. They show, that in box calculations the differences between the codes can be well understood and a convergence of the results can be reached. These studies also highlight the systematic differences between the two families of transport codes, known under the names of BoltzmannâUehlingâUhlenbeck (BUU) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) type codes. However, when the codes were compared in full heavy-ion collisions using different physical models, as recently for pion production, they still yielded substantially different results. This calls for further comparisons of heavy-ion collisions with controlled models and of box comparisons of important ingredients, like momentum-dependent fields, which are currently underway. Our evaluation studies often indicate improved strategies in performing transport simulations and thus can provide guidance to code developers. Results of transport simulations of heavy-ion collisions from a given code will have more significance if the code can be validated against benchmark calculations such as the ones summarized in this review.}

        Abstract = {Experimental information on fragment emissions is important in understanding the dynamics of nuclear collisions and in the development of transport model simulating heavy-ion collisions. The composition of complex fragments emitted in the heavy-ion collisions can be explained by statistical models, which assume that thermal equilibrium is achieved at collision energies below 100 MeV/u. Our new experimental data together with theoretical analyses for light particles from Sn+Sn collisions at 270 MeV/u, suggest that the hypothesis of thermal equilibrium breaks down for particles emitted with high transfer momentum. To inspect the system's properties in such limit, the scaling features of the yield ratios of particles from two systems, a neutron-rich system of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}132{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}+{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}124{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}{\$}{\$}and a nearly symmetric system of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}108{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}+{\{}{\}}\^{}{\{}112{\}}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}Sn{\}}{\$}{\$}, are examined in the framework of the statistical multifragmentation model and the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model. The isoscaling from low energy particles agree with both models. However the observed breakdown of isoscaling for particles with high transverse momentum cannot be explained by the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model.},

abstract = {The large imbalance in the neutron and proton densities in very neutron rich systems increases the nuclear symmetry energy so that it governs many aspects of neutron stars and their mergers. Extracting the density dependence of the symmetry energy therefore constitutes an important scientific objective. Many analyses have been limited to extracting values for the symmetry energy, S0, and its “derivative”, L, at saturation density ρ0≈2.6×1014g/cm3 ≈0.16nucleons/fm3, resulting in constraints that appear contradictory. We show that most experimental observables actually probe the symmetry energy at densities far from ρ0, making the extracted values of S0 or L imprecise. By focusing on the densities these observables actually probe, we obtain a detailed picture of the density dependence of the symmetry energy from 0.25ρ0 to 2.0ρ0. From this experimentally derived density functional, we extract L01=54±6 MeV corresponding to the symmetry pressure of P01=1.8±0.2 MeV/fm3 at ρ≈0.10fm−3, a neutron skin thickness for P208b of Rnp=0.23±0.03 fm, and symmetry pressure at saturation density of P0=4.4±1.3 MeV/fm3. The extrapolated symmetry pressure at high density is consistent with results from recent measurements of neutron star radii from NICER and deformability from LIGO.}
